# python_module_scaffold

Helps reduce the boilerplate in setting up a Python package.


## Usage

This scaffolding uses [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for creating a project from a template. You will need a recent version of cookiecutter installed (>=1.6.0) to ensure all features of this work.

Before you start make sure you install cookiecutter:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

To use this project template:

```bash
cookiecutter /path/to/template
```
